In this paper, a genetic programming algorithm and different data mining approaches are proposed for solving these problems using real data about 670 high school students from Zacatecas, Mexico. Firstly, we select the best attributes in order to resolve the problem of high dimensionality. Then, rebalancing of data and cost sensitive classification have been applied in order to resolve the problem of classifying imbalanced data. We also propose to use a genetic programming model versus different white box techniques in order to obtain both more comprehensible and accuracy classification rules. The outcomes of each approach are shown and compared in order to select the best to improve \u2026",

The simple principle of data gravitation classification (DGC) is to classify data samples by comparing the gravitation between different classes. However, the calculation of gravitation is not a trivial problem due to the different relevance of data attributes for distance computation, the presence of noisy or irrelevant attributes, and the class imbalance problem. This paper presents a gravitation-based classification algorithm which improves previous gravitation models and overcomes some of their issues. The proposed algorithm, called DGC+, employs a matrix of weights to describe the importance of each attribute in the classification of each class, which is used to weight the distance between data samples. It improves the classification performance by considering both global \u2026",

The method learns disjunctive normal form rules generated by means of a context-free grammar. The individual constitutes a rule based decision list that represents the full classifier. To overcome the problem of computational time of this system, it parallelizes the evaluation phase reducing significantly the computation time. Moreover, different operator genetics are designed to maintain the diversity of the population and get a compact set of rules. The results obtained have been validated by the use of non-parametric statistical tests, showing a good performance in terms of accuracy and interpretability.",

However, extremely high-dimensional optimization problems comprising millions of variables demand new approaches to perform effectively in results quality and efficiently in time. Memetic algorithms are popular in continuous optimization but they are hampered on such extremely large dimensionality due to the limitations of computational and memory resources, and heuristics must tackle the immensity of the search space. This work advances on how the MapReduce parallel programming model allows scaling to problems with millions of variables, and presents an adaptation of the MA-SW-Chains algorithm to the MapReduce framework.

This paper presents a parallel GP interpreter which extends these approaches and adds a new parallelization level based on the concurrent evaluation of the individual's subtrees. A GP individual defined by a tree structure with nodes and branches comprises different depth levels in which there are independent subtrees which can be evaluated concurrently.

Stochastic gradient descent methods are popular tools used to optimize large-scale learning problems because of their generalization performance, simplicity, and scalability. This paper proposes a novel stochastic, also known as online, learning algorithm for solving the L1 support vector machine (SVM) problem, named OnLine Learning Algorithm using Worst-Violators (OLLAWV). Unlike other stochastic methods, OLLAWV eliminates the need for specifying the maximum number of iterations and the use of a regularization term. OLLAWV uses early stopping for controlling the size of the margin instead of the regularization term. The experimental study, performed under very strict nested cross-validation (aka, double resampling), evaluates and compares the performance of this proposal with state-of-the-art SVM kernel methods that have been shown to outperform traditional and widely used approaches for solving L1-SVMs such as Sequential Minimal Optimization. OLLAWV is also compared to 5 other traditional non-SVM algorithms.

This paper introduces a massively parallel implementation on GPUs of a differential evolution algorithm for learning classification rules in the presence of concept drift. The proposal based on the DE /rand - to - best/1/bin strategy takes advantage of up to four nested levels of parallelism to maximize the performance of the algorithm. Efficient GPU kernels parallelize the evolution of the populations, rules, conditional clauses, and evaluation on instances. The proposed method is evaluated on 25 data stream \u2026",

Wireless vision sensor networks deployed throughout high-risk areas can perform fine-grained surveillance and thereby very early detection and precise location of forest fires. One of the fundamental requirements that need to be met at the network nodes is reliable low-power on-site image processing. It greatly simplifies the communication infrastructure of the network as only alarm signals instead of complete images are transmitted, anticipating thus a very competitive cost. As a first approximation to fulfill such a requirement, this paper reports the results achieved from field tests carried out in collaboration with the Andalusian Fire-Fighting Service (INFOCA). Two controlled burns of forest debris were realized (www.youtube.com/user/vmoteProject). Smoke was successfully detected on-site by the EyeRISTM v1.2, a general-purpose autonomous vision system, built by AnaFocus Ltd., in which a vision algorithm was programmed. No false alarm was triggered despite the significant motion other than smoke present in the scene. Finally, as a further step, we describe the preliminary laboratory results obtained from a prototype vision chip which implements, at very low energy cost, some image processing primitives oriented to environmental monitoring.",

The second approach (CSS) implements SS on a cluster architecture by scheduling independent jobs to workers in a cluster. The third, (CGSS) accelerates the frequent itemset mining process by using multiple cluster nodes equipped with GPUs. Moreover, three partitioning strategies are proposed to reduce GPU thread divergence and cluster load imbalance. Results show that CGSS outperforms SS, GSS, and CSS in terms of speedup.

While most of works in this field focus on proposing novel and accurate classification algorithms, the issue of the computational complexity on growing dataset sizes is somehow marginalized. Owning to the ever-increasing capabilities of data capturing, we are faced with the problem of large-scale data mining that forces learners to be not only highly accurate, but also fast and scalable on high-dimensional spaces of instances, features, and labels. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient parallel approach for computing the multi-label k-Nearest Neighbor classifier on GPUs. While this method is highly effective due to its accuracy and simplicity, its computational complexity makes it prohibitive for large-scale data. We propose a four-step implementation that takes an advantage of the GPU architecture, allowing for an efficient execution of the multi-label k-Nearest Neighbors classifier without any loss of accuracy. Experiments carried out on a number of real and artificial benchmarks show that we are able to achieve speedups up to 200 times when compared to a sequential CPU execution, while efficiently scaling up to varying number of instances and features.",

A common countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics. An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts. Despite many proposed methods to identify such subset, none are scalable enough to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays billion-size networks.\nTo this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek most effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of edges, yet, possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At the core of our methods is an -space out-of-core algorithm to generate a new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (HSAWs). Such a low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly, hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provides much higher quality solutions and are several order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU and 338x on a GPU pair.\nSubjects: Social and Information Networks (cs.

            "Description": "This paper presents a novel self-adaptive grammar-guided genetic programming proposal for mining association rules. It generates individuals through a context-free grammar, which allows of defining rules in an expressive and flexible way over different domains. Each rule is represented as a derivation tree that shows a solution (described using the language) denoted by the grammar. Unlike existing evolutionary algorithms for mining association rules, the proposed algorithm only requires a small number of parameters, providing the possibility of discovering association rules in an easy way for non-expert users. More specifically, this algorithm does not require any threshold, and uses a novel parent selector based on a niche-crowding model to group rules. This approach keeps the",

El principio de la clasificaci\u00f3n gravitatoria es clasificar los ejemplos mediante la comparaci\u00f3n de la atracci\u00f3n gravitatoria a las distintas clases. Este art\u0131culo presenta un algoritmo de clasificaci\u00f3n gravitatoria que mejora los modelos gravitatorios existentes y soluciona algunos de sus problemas. El algoritmo propuesto, denominado IGCA (Improved Gravitation Classification Algorithm), es capaz de trabajar con atributos num\u00e9ricos y nominales, filtrar atributos ruidosos o irrelevantes, y alcanzar buenos resultados sobre conjuntos de datos no balanceados. La propuesta emplea una matriz de pesos para describir la importancia de cada atributo en la clasificaci\u00f3n de cada clase y mejora la exactitud en la clasificaci\u00f3n al considerar tanto la informaci\u00f3n global como local de los datos, especialmente en los ejemplos cercanos a la frontera entre clases. La propuesta se eval\u00faa y compara con otros 6 algoritmos de clasificaci\u00f3n, incluyendo un modelo gravitatorio previo, sobre 30 conjuntos de datos. Los resultados obtenidos de la experimentaci\u00f3n muestran los buenos resultados de nuestro modelo gravitatorio y se validan mediante tests estad\u0131sticos no param\u00e9tricos.",

The first category groups solutions that detect flow outliers and includes statistical, similarity, and pattern mining approaches. The second category contains solutions where the trajectory outliers are derived, including offline processing for trajectory outliers and online processing for sub-trajectory outliers. Solutions in each of these categories are described, illustrated, and discussed, and open perspectives and research trends are drawn. Compared to state-of-the-art survey papers, the contribution of this paper lies in providing a deep analysis of all the kinds of representations in urban traffic data, including flow values, segment flow values, trajectories, and sub-trajectories. In this context, we can better understand the intuition \u2026",

This paper explores advances in the outlier detection area by finding anomalies in spatio-temporal urban traffic flow. It proposes a new approach by considering the distribution of the flows in a given time interval. The flow distribution probability (FDP) databases are first constructed from the traffic flows by considering both spatial and temporal information. The outlier detection mechanism is then applied to the coming flow distribution probabilities, the inliers are stored to enrich the FDP databases while the outliers are excluded from the FDP databases. Moreover, a k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for distance-based outlier detection is investigated and adopted for flow distribution probability outlier detection. To validate the \u2026",

Performance gains, provided by protecting composite data structure accesses and by another layer of knowledge into strong typing, are presented.

Specifically, we pursue to improve the performance, scalability, interpretability and accuracy of classification models on challenging data. The performance and scalability of evolutionary-based classification models were improved through parallel computation on GPUs, which demonstrated to achieve high efficiency on speeding up classification algorithms. The conflicting problem of the interpretability and accuracy of the classification models was addressed through a highly interpretable classification algorithm which produced very comprehensible classifiers by means of classification rules. Performance on challenging data such as the imbalanced classification was improved by means of a data gravitation classification algorithm which demonstrated to achieve better classification performance both on balanced and imbalanced data. All the methods proposed in this Thesis were evaluated in a proper experimental framework, by using a large number of data sets with diverse dimensionality and by comparing their performance against other state-ofthe-art and recently published methods of proved quality. The experimental results obtained have been verified by applying non-parametric statistical tests which support the better performance of the methods proposed.
