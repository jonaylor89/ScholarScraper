# Frontend

- Typescript
- Angular

For a front-end I'll let Russia handle that because of her experience with Angular. 
It shouldn't be a hard front-end so nothing crazy beautiful. If we do have time and
want to go extra than we can have a page that displays a graph of the names of papers
with citations among them. As well as something to work with backend and front end routes.

# Backend

- Flask
- SQL
- Docker
