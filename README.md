# Frontend

**So far the only thing I've done to the frontend is bootstrap the angular app and set the api url to point to the backend**

- Typescript
- Angular

For a front-end I'll let Russia handle that because of her experience with Angular. 
It shouldn't be a hard front-end so nothing crazy beautiful. If we do have time and
want to go extra than we can have a page that displays a graph of the names of papers
with citations among them. As well as something to work with backend and front end routes.

# Backend

- Flask
- SQL
- Docker

# Execution 

To execute both the frontend and backend on your local machine for development, 
just run the `quickstart.sh` script. It does require docker and the angular cli
to run things but otherwise that's it. To run either the frontend or backend individually
check the *README.md* in their repective directory.
